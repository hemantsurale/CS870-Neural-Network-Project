# CS870-Neural-Network-Project
As a part of the course CS870 - Neural networks at University of Waterloo, we've built a hand microgesture classifier. 
Currently the highest accuracy we could achieve is in the range of 44% - 57%. Feel free to use this code and improve
further.


more details, coming soon...
